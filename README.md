#Assignment 1

A RESTful API assignment that implements an html client side and a node.js server side.

This simple assignment is assuming that the grader will be working within the original favs.json. As there was no need to create any new users all user IDs should be known to exist in the local database in the context of posting tweets and getting user tweets.

0. To run this web application you must have the latest version of node.js installed on your computer. Any command stated below should be entered without the ' ' characters. 

1. Open the Tweet_API folder using your favorite source code editor

2. When in the Tweet_API directory, open a terminal and run the command'npm install' to install the node_modules file into the directory. This is for all the necessary dependancies to run the web application.

3. Once all dependancies are installed, you can run the command 'npm start' to start the server the web application will run on. 

4. in your choice of web browser, go to the url and type localhost:3000 and an html page should open with all the required RESTful API tests. 

5. Begin running any tests
